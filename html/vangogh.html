                <p class="artists_p">Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter whose bold colors and emotional brushwork profoundly influenced modern art. In just over a decade, he produced about 2,100 artworks, including 860 oil paintings, many created in the last two years of his life. Though largely unrecognized in his lifetime—he sold only one painting—he is now considered one of the most important figures in Western art.<br>Born into a middle-class family, Van Gogh struggled with mental health throughout his life. After working as an art dealer and missionary, he began painting in 1881 with financial support from his brother Theo. He moved to Paris in 1886, where he met avant-garde artists, and later to Arles, where his work became brighter and more expressive.<br>His friendship with Paul Gauguin ended in a breakdown, during which Van Gogh famously cut off part of his ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals before dying by suicide at age 37. Posthumously, Van Gogh became a symbol of the misunderstood genius, and his expressive style influenced major 20th-century art movements. Today, his works are among the most celebrated and valuable in the world, with a dedicated museum in Amsterdam.</p>
