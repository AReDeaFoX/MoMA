        <h1>-Broadway Boogie Woogie-</h1>
        <p class="center">Broadway Boogie Woogie is a vibrant painting by Piet Mondrian, completed in 1943 after his move to New York in 1940. Departing from his earlier minimalist compositions, this piece features a dynamic grid of smaller, brightly colored squares. While Mondrian is known for pure abstraction, this work draws direct inspiration from real-world elements: the structured city grid of Manhattan and the rhythm of boogie-woogie, a lively African-American blues style he deeply admired.<br>The painting was purchased for $800 by Brazilian sculptor Maria Martins at the Valentine Gallery in New York, where both she and Mondrian exhibited in 1943. She later donated the piece to the Museum of Modern Art, where it remains part of the collection. Broadway Boogie Woogie is often seen as a joyful celebration of Mondrian’s fascination with New York’s energy and music.<br><br>When Piet Mondrian arrived in New York, he became fond of the neat, rigid architecture. He integrated the mood and tone of jazz into this work. Mondrian called it the “destruction of natural appearance; and construction through continuous opposition of pure means - dynamic rhythm.</p>
