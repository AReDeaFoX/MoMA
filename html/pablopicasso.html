                <p class="artists_p">Pablo Picasso (1881–1973) was a Spanish artist whose groundbreaking work made him one of the most influential figures in 20th-century art. A master painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer, Picasso spent most of his adult life in France and pioneered many artistic movements<br>He is best known for co-founding Cubism, a revolutionary style that fragmented objects into geometric forms. He also helped invent collage and constructed sculpture, constantly pushing artistic boundaries. His most iconic works include Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (1907), a proto-Cubist piece that shocked audiences, and Guernica (1937), a powerful anti-war painting responding to the Spanish Civil War.<br>Trained by his father from a young age, Picasso showed immense talent early on. His style evolved through several distinct periods: the Blue Period, Rose Period, African-influenced Period, Analytic Cubism, and Synthetic Cubism, later moving into neoclassicism and surrealism.<br>Picasso's output was vast and diverse, and he remained creatively active well into old age. His fierce originality, constant reinvention, and sheer volume of work earned him international fame and wealth. Today, Picasso is remembered as a symbol of modern art, having influenced generations of artists and redefined what art could be.</p>
