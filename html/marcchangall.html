                <p class="artists_p">Marc Chagall (1887–1985) was a Russian-French artist known for his unique modernist style and wide-ranging works including painting, stained glass, ceramics, and stage design. Born into a Jewish family near Vitebsk (now Belarus), he blended Eastern European and Jewish folklore with modern art movements.<br>Before World War I, Chagall moved between Saint Petersburg, Paris, and Berlin, developing his distinct style. During the war, he returned to Belarus, where he became a leading avant-garde artist and founded the Vitebsk Arts College. After struggling in post-revolution Russia, he resettled in Paris in 1923. During World War II, he fled Nazi-occupied France and lived in New York for seven years before returning to France in 1948.<br>Chagall is celebrated as “the quintessential Jewish artist of the twentieth century” and regarded as the last of the first-generation European modernists. His work spans many mediums, including famous stained glass windows for cathedrals in Reims and Metz, the UN headquarters, and the Jerusalem Windows. He also painted large-scale works like the ceiling of the Paris Opéra.<br>Chagall combined Cubism, Symbolism, and Fauvism influences, yet his art remained deeply rooted in Jewish culture and his memories of Vitebsk. Picasso praised him for his mastery of color, saying he truly understood its power.</p>
