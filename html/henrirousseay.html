                <p class="artists_p">Henri Rousseau (1844–1910) was a French Post-Impressionist painter celebrated for his Naïve or Primitive style. Often called Le Douanier (the customs officer), Rousseau worked as a toll collector before turning to art full-time in his late 40s, having started painting seriously only a few years earlier.<br>Largely self-taught, Rousseau was mocked by critics early on but eventually recognized as a visionary whose unique style influenced many modern artists. His work is marked by vivid colors, flat perspectives, and imaginative scenes—especially his famous jungle paintings, such as Tiger in a Tropical Storm (Surprised!), despite never having left France. He gathered inspiration from botanical gardens, zoo visits, and illustrated books.<br>Rousseau exhibited frequently at the Salon des Indépendants beginning in 1886. His painting The Sleeping Gypsy (1897) is one of his most iconic works, depicting a mysterious figure in a dreamlike desert scene. In 1905, his jungle-themed painting The Hungry Lion was shown alongside works by the Fauves, earning him renewed attention.<br>Though he lived modestly in Paris, Rousseau’s creativity, originality, and determination helped secure his legacy. Today, he is regarded as a key figure who paved the way for modernist movements and inspired generations of avant-garde artists.</p>
