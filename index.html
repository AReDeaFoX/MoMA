                <h1>-Introduction-</h1>
                <p>The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), located in Midtown Manhattan, is one of the world’s most influential institutions for modern and contemporary art. Founded in 1929, MoMA holds a collection of over 200,000 works, including painting, sculpture, photography, design, film, and new media, spanning from the late 19th century to today. The museum has played a central role in shaping the story of modern art through groundbreaking exhibitions and innovative programming. Over the decades, MoMA has undergone major expansions, forged partnerships, and increasingly focused on representing diverse and underrepresented voices in the art world.</p>
                <br>

                <h1>-History-</h1>
                <p>Founded in 1929 by Abby Rockefeller and friends, MoMA opened shortly after the Wall Street Crash. Led by Alfred H. Barr Jr., it overcame early challenges, grew quickly, and pioneered departments like photography and film, shaping its global impact.</p>
                <h5>~1930s to 1950s~</h5>
                <p>In the late 1930s and 1940s, MoMA rose to global prominence with major exhibitions and the opening of its modernist home on West 53rd Street. Led by Nelson and later David Rockefeller, the museum expanded in scope and influence.</p>
                <h5>~1958 fire~</h5>
                <p>In 1958, a fire at MoMA—caused by workmen smoking near flammable materials—destroyed a large Monet Water Lilies painting and claimed one life. While most artworks had been moved, a few major pieces remained, including the Monet. Staff and visitors were evacuated, some via the roof, and nearby museums helped safeguard additional works. A replacement Monet was acquired shortly after.</p>
                <h5>~1960s to 1980s~</h5>
                <p>In 1969, MoMA withdrew support for the antiwar poster And Babies, sparking controversy. It later appeared in the 1970 Information show. Protests in 1971 and 1984 called out the museum’s lack of diversity and female representation. Though expanded in the 1980s, MoMA still faced space limitations for its growing collection.</p>
                <h5>~1990s and 2000s renovation~</h5>
                <p>By the late 20th century, MoMA expanded its collection and space with a major renovation by Yoshio Taniguchi, nearly doubling its galleries. It merged with P.S. 1 in 2000 and closed for renovations from 2002 to 2004. The $858 million project had mixed reviews. In 2007, MoMA sold nearby land for a planned skyscraper, delayed by the recession.</p>
                <h5>~2010s to present~</h5>
                <p> 2010, MoMA merged with P.S.1, renaming it MoMA PS1. In 2011, it bought and later demolished the nearby American Folk Art Museum building to build the 53W53 tower and expand the museum. The $450 million expansion added 50,000 sq ft of gallery space and new lounges, increasing public space by 25%. After further renovations, MoMA reopened in 2019 with 47,000 more square feet of galleries.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h1>-Attendance-</h1>
                <p>In 2020, MoMA’s attendance dropped sharply to 706,060 visitors—a 65% decline from 2019—due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ranking it 25th among the most visited art museums globally. Prior to the pandemic, MoMA had seen significant growth in attendance, rising from an average of 1.5 million visitors annually to 2.8 million following its major renovation. The museum hit a record 3.09 million visitors in 2010, though numbers slightly declined to 2.8 million by 2016. Originally open every day since its founding in 1929, MoMA began closing one day a week in 1975 to save costs, but resumed daily operations in 2012.</p>
